# Introduction to Long Context Window with Gemini on Vertex AI

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and related materials from the Google Cloud Skills Boost lab: **Introduction to Long Context Window with Gemini on Vertex AI (GSP1276).**

## Overview

Gemini 1.5 Flash and Pro offer expansive context windows, capable of handling up to 1 million and 2 million tokens, respectively. This lab explores the capabilities of Gemini 1.5's long context window, demonstrating its potential for processing extensive text, video, and audio data within a single prompt. You'll learn how tokenization works for different modalities and understand the advantages of this extended capacity for in-context learning and complex multimodal tasks.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Understand the concept of context windows and tokenization in Large Language Models (LLMs).
* Learn how to utilize the long context window of `gemini-1.5-flash` for multimodal prompts.
* Explore practical applications of long context windows in handling extensive text, video, and audio data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should have:

* Basic understanding of Python programming.
* General knowledge of how APIs work.
* Experience running Python code in Jupyter notebooks within Vertex AI Workbench.

## Lab Content

The repository includes:

* **`intro_long_context.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the lab exercises.

## Lab Tasks

1.  **Open the notebook in Vertex AI Workbench:**
    * Navigate to Vertex AI > Workbench in the Google Cloud console.
